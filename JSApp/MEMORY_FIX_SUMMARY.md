# Memory Management Fix Summary

## Problem
The app was accumulating memory (reaching 16GB) after running multiple analyses because:
1. **WASM Memory Limitation**: WebAssembly memory can only grow, never shrink
2. **Model Accumulation**: Models weren't being properly disposed after use
3. **No True Memory Release**: `dispose()` only marks memory as reusable, doesn't free it

## Solution: Web Worker Isolation

### Key Implementation
Created a **Web Worker** to run transformers.js models in an isolated context. When the worker is terminated, ALL memory is completely freed.

### Architecture Changes

#### 1. New Worker Files
- **`src/workers/transformers.worker.ts`**: Runs models in isolated worker context
- **`src/models/WorkerModelManager.ts`**: Manages worker lifecycle and communication

#### 2. Modified Files
- **`MultiModelAnalyzer.ts`**: Added `useWorker` option, worker initialization/termination
- **`StreamingAnalysisController.ts`**: Calls worker termination after analysis
- **`ModelManager.ts`**: Enhanced `unloadModel()` with proper disposal methods
- **`main.ts`**: Enabled worker mode by default

### How It Works

1. **Analysis Starts**: Worker is initialized
2. **Models Load**: Models are loaded into the worker's isolated memory
3. **Inference Runs**: All model inference happens in the worker
4. **Analysis Completes**: Worker is terminated, **COMPLETELY FREEING ALL MEMORY**

### Memory Management Strategy

#### Before (Memory Leak)
```
Run 1: Load models → Run inference → "Dispose" (memory stays) → 1.5GB used
Run 2: Load models → Run inference → "Dispose" (memory grows) → 3GB used
Run 3: Load models → Run inference → "Dispose" (memory grows) → 4.5GB used
... Eventually reaches 16GB
```

#### After (Complete Cleanup)
```
Run 1: Create worker → Load models → Run inference → Terminate worker → 0GB used
Run 2: Create worker → Load models → Run inference → Terminate worker → 0GB used
Run 3: Create worker → Load models → Run inference → Terminate worker → 0GB used
... Memory never accumulates
```

### Configuration

Worker mode is enabled by default in `main.ts`:
```typescript
this.multiModelAnalyzer = new MultiModelAnalyzer(
  this.analyzerRegistry.getModelManager(),
  { useWorker: true }  // Enables complete memory cleanup
);
```

### User Control

The "Keep models cached" checkbox still works:
- **Unchecked (default)**: Worker terminates after each analysis, freeing all memory
- **Checked**: Worker stays alive, models remain in memory for faster subsequent runs

### Benefits

1. **Complete Memory Cleanup**: Terminating worker frees ALL memory
2. **No Memory Accumulation**: Each analysis starts fresh
3. **Isolated Execution**: Models run in separate context
4. **Backward Compatible**: Non-worker mode still available if needed

### Technical Notes

- Worker termination is the ONLY way to truly free WASM memory
- The browser immediately reclaims all worker memory upon termination
- Results (10KB) are preserved in main thread - only models are cleared
- Worker is recreated for each analysis session

## Testing

1. Run analysis with multiple models
2. Check browser memory usage
3. Run analysis again
4. Memory should return to baseline after each run

## Future Improvements

- Could add worker pooling for parallel model execution
- Could implement progressive model loading to reduce initial load time
- Could add memory usage monitoring UI
