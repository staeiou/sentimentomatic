    "This has to be the worst movie I have seen. Madsen fans don't be drawn into this trap.",
    "I'm going to spend as much time on this review as the writers did on the script. See, I'm done.",
    "The film gets my stamp of approval. The scene in the museum demands acting without dialogue and the performers are more than capable. Excellent performances.",
    "Myself and my groovadelic 20-something pals just can't get enough of this awesome music showcase. Definitely of the best performances ever recorded on film.",
    "'The Mother' is that extraordinary piece of film making - it gets you thinking, it pulls the tears, it makes you laugh and it leaves you hopeful.",
    "I really like this movie. I can watch it on a regular basis and not tire of it. Very funny in a sophomoric kind of way.",
    "There is great detail in A Bug's Life. Everything is covered. The film looks great.",
    "A DAMN GOOD MOVIE! One that is seriously underrated. The songs that the children sing will STAY in your head for days.",
    "Saving Grace is a feel good movie with it's heart in the right place. Grace is resilient, charming and likable.",
    "I couldn't wait to receive the DVD after hearing so much about the film. What a disappointment!",
    "Keenan Ivory Wayans is probably one of the worst directors, i swear he has no respect for intelligent comedy.",
    "After a big tip of the hat to Spinal Tap, this movie is hilarious. Anyone who grew up in the 80s will appreciate the humor.",
    "I don't care how many bad reviews purple rain gets, this movie rocks! Excellent music!",
    "This movie is horrible if you pay attention to it. It's a perfect movie if you just want to zone out.",
    "I'll be blunt. I'm not one for politically correct movies where the woman plays the tough guy role better than any man could.",
    "This is the greatest film I saw in 2002, whereas I'm used to mainstream movies. The cinematography alone is worth the price.",
    "The only reason that I did not give this 10 stars was the DVD format-no menus, etc.",
    "This film really disappointed me. The acting is atrocious. Unbelievable. And it's a shame because the premise had potential.",
    "This movie was lame, lame, lame. What a build up! What a let down. All form, no substance.",
    "Yes, the plot is predictable; yes, there are a few plot holes; yes, it has a made-for-TV feel. But you know what? I still enjoyed it.",
    "This movie was probably the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting was terrible, the plot was non-existent, and the special effects were laughable.",
    "I enjoy watching people doing breakdance, especially if they do it as well as in this movie.",
    "There are so many reasons as to why I rate the sopranos so highly, one of its biggest achievements is its brilliant character development.",
    "When I went to watch this movie my expectations were really low, but I was pleasantly surprised. Great performances all around.",
    "Having lived in Japan for several years this movie does not reflect the Japanese culture at all. Completely inaccurate.",
    "The good thing about this film is that it stands alone - you don't have to have seen any of the previous films to understand what's happening.",
    "Great Woody Allen? No. Good Woody Allen? Definitely. I found myself, along with the audience, laughing throughout.",
    "The Rookie kept me smiling from beginning to end. Dennis Quaid played the role to perfection.",
    "How nice to have a movie the entire family can watch together. Josie Bissett and the entire cast were wonderful.",
    "For people interested in business and the corporate world, this show is simply the best thing on television.",
    "Since I first saw this in the theater it has been my favorite. Since then I've seen it countless times and it never gets old.",
    "As someone else commented, this is a feel-good movie. It's got glorious scenery and wonderful acting.",
    "This movie is one of my very favorites. It's hard to explain why. Maybe it's the great writing, or the wonderful chemistry between the actors.",
    "I thought the movie was actually pretty good. I enjoyed the acting and it moved along at a nice pace.",
    "What a delightful romp - a very competently made film that has so much charm and humor.",
    "In my opinion, this is the best stand-up show I have ever seen. I became an instant fan.",
    "The sword fighting was out of this world, the fights scenes spectacular without being over the top.",
    "This is a quirky movie that the Brits do so well. Low budget, cameo type roles, but so much heart.",
    "What a fascinating film. Even if it wasn't based on real life, Forbidden Lies was gripping from start to finish.",
    "This is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. The Footage is extraordinary.",
    "Rob Roy is and underrated epic of passion and action!",
    "One of my favorite movies I saw at preview in Seattle. Tom Hulce was amazing, with an Oscar-worthy performance.",
    "It was a painful experience, the whole story is actually there so I won't go into detail but seriously, don't waste your time.",
    "I caught this at a test screening. All I can say is: What...the...hell? This movie makes no sense whatsoever.",
    "Kalifornia is disturbing. I believe there is no reason for this story to be told. Exploitative garbage.",
    "This low budget B horror's plot comes with all the amenities - mad scientist complex, creepy house, terrible acting.",
    "This film might have weak production values, but that is also what makes it so genuine and heartfelt.",
    "George P. Cosmatos' \"Rambo: First Blood Part II\" is pure wish-fulfillment. The ultimate 80s action film.",
    "Really, the use of stock nature documentary of swarming bats employed by THE BAT PEOPLE is insulting to the audience.",
    "Gandhi My Father is a well made movie. It nicely portrays the life of Gandhiji's son with sensitivity and depth."
